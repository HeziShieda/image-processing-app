# Image Color-space Converter & Enhancer

A basic image processing application written in Python, implementing fundamental image processing algorithms **from scratch** (without using OpenCV).

## Features
- Color space conversions: RGB, HSV, YCbCr, CMYK, Grayscale
- Gaussian blur, Median filter, Sharpening
- Histogram Equalization
- Brightness / Contrast adjustment
- Histogram visualization for original and processed images

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pillow
- Tkinter

## Project Scope
- Implement core image processing algorithms manually
- Understand color space transformations and spatial filtering
- Practice NumPy-based matrix operations
- Build a simple GUI using Tkinter

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```md
> This project focuses on understanding image processing algorithms rather than performance optimization.
